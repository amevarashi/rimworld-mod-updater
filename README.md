# RimWorld Mod Updater
[-> Download here <-](https://github.com/amevarashi/rimworld-mod-updater/releases/latest)

RimWorld ~~RJW~~Mod Updater is an app for discovering and downloading updates to RimWorld mods that aren't available on the Steam Workshop. It currently comes preset with RJW and its sub-mods. All mods are downloaded from GitHub or GitLab.

This app only dowmloads mods to your `Mods` folder, it does not add them to your active mods list. You can use [RimSort](https://github.com/RimSort/RimSort), [RimPy](https://github.com/rimpy-custom/RimPy/) or the in-game mod manager to enable and sort the mods.

## Features
* No external dependencies
* Always up-to-date
* Works from any folder
* Automatically detects RimWorld installations when installed through Steam

## Usage
1. Download the latest executable from the [Releases page](https://github.com/amevarashi/rimworld-mod-updater/releases) and run it. This app will automatically update itself whenever you launch it, so you don't have to worry about downloading updates.
2. If you are using a non-Steam version of the game, go to the "Settings" tab and select your `Rimworld` folder. In that folder there must be a `Mods` subfolder and a `Version.txt` file.
3. Switch to the "Mods" tab and wait for the mod list to download.
4. Tick the checkboxes next to the mods you want to download or update. Any installed mods that have updates will be pre-selected for you.
5. Click the "Download or Update Selected" button in the bottom-right corner of the window.
6. Enjoy your progress bars!
